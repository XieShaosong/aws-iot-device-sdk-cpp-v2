# AWS IoT SDK for C++ v2
This document provides information about the AWS IoT device SDK for C++ V2.

This project is in **GENERAL AVAILABILITY**. If you have any issues or feature
requests, please file an issue or pull request.

This SDK is built on the AWS Common Runtime, a collection of libraries
([aws-c-common](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-common),
[aws-c-io](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-io),
[aws-c-mqtt](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-mqtt),
[aws-c-http](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-http),
[aws-c-cal](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-cal),
[aws-c-auth](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-auth),
[s2n](https://github.com/awslabs/s2n)...) written in C to be
cross-platform, high-performance, secure, and reliable. The libraries are bound
to C++ by the [aws-crt-cpp](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-crt-cpp) package.

# Installation

## Minimum Requirements
*   C++ 11 or higher
*   CMake 3.1+
*   Clang 3.9+ or GCC 4.4+ or MSVC 2015+


## Build from source
### Automatically Build and Install AWS Dependencies
```
mkdir sdk-cpp-workspace
cd sdk-cpp-workspace
git clone --recursive https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2.git
mkdir aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2-build
cd aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2-build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="<absolute path sdk-cpp-workspace dir>"  -DBUILD_DEPS=ON ../aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2
cmake --build . --target install
```
### Using a Pre-Built aws-crt-cpp (Most useful for development of this package)

```
mkdir aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2-build
cd aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2-build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="<absolute path sdk-cpp-workspace dir>"  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="<absolute path sdk-cpp-workspace dir>" -DBUILD_DEPS=OFF ../aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2
cmake --build . --target install
```
